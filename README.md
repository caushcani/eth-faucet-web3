this is a simple web3 interaction with ethereum.

i used ganache to set up an ethereum blockchain, along with truffle.

web3js to interact from frontend part.

to star this project:
1 - clone the project
2 - setup ganache and truffle
3 - connect truffle-config.js to ganache.
4 - run truffle migrate
5 - get contract's deployed address and add to frontend part (already declared a constant called ADDR)
6 - setup metamask with ganache and import an account from ganache accounts list.

happy hacking! :P
